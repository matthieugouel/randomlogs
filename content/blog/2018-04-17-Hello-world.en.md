Hi ! My name is Matthieu Gouel. I'm a french DevOps engineer, fan of Python, automation and stuff. I started programming pretty young and then I made a engineer school with a specialization in computer systems and networks.

More generally I’m interested in lots of subjects not necessarily related to computers. I truly like learning new things, and then trying to build something out of it.

This blog is meant to share my thoughts and what I learn day to day. It's not something very serious, more like a succession of "random logs" of my personal experience.

Ah and don’t hesitate to correct my English in the comments. I will not take it badly, on the contrary, this blog is also a way for me to improve english skills !

Have a nice day,  
Matthieu.
